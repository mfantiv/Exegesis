# Introduction

When Paul admonished the people of Philippi that their community of believers should live in unity—selflessly looking after the needs of each other rather than obsessing over their own troubles—he chose the selfless acts of Jesus Christ as the model of and motivation for this selflessness. Paul provides an illustration of obedience-no-matter-the-cost in one of the most memorable early Christian hymns recorded in the New Testament (Philippians 2:6–11).

Yet scholars disagree whether this “cosmic drama” was a well-known anonymous hymn adapted by Paul (and perhaps changed, redacted, or amended) for his own purpose or composed by Paul himself.^[“The debated matter is still whether Paul is the author of the hymn (against Pauline authorship see Käsemann, ZTK 47 [1950] 313–60; Bonnard; Beare; Georgi, “Der vorpaulinische Hymnus”; Martin, _Carmen Christi,_ 45–54 [more confidently in rev ed. (1983), xxxiv; 3d ed. (1997), lv–lxv]; Gnilka; for older suggestions of Pauline authorship see Michaelis; Dibelius; Scott; Furness, ExpTim 70 [1958–59] 240–43; Martin, _Carmen Christi,_ 55–62). Those espousing Pauline authorship, while still found (e.g., O’Brien; Fee [1995]; Wright, “_ἁρπαγμός_,” 57; Oakes, _Philippians,_ 212), are really swimming against the tide as far as European and American scholarship is concerned.” (Hawthorne, 103)] Regardless of the original source, Paul’s decision to include this poem here causes many interpretive challenges with few completely convincing answers. Even among evangelical scholars, many disagree of these matters disagree on both the answer to the origination and how seriously their conclusion would affect interpretation.

Despite these interpretative challenges, Christians who look to Paul’s letter to the Philippians, and especially chapter 2, are struck by this poetic call to corporate unity through humility—a persistent challenge for every church community even into the twenty-first century.

# Structure, Translation, and Meaning

The text under consideration, Philippians 2:1–18, exists within the first major portion of the body of the letter: 1:12–2:30 (the second portion being 3:1–4:9).^[David Alan Black, “The Discourse Structure of Philippians: A Study in Textlinguistics,” _Novum Testamentum_ 37 (1995): 16–49, 30.]

## The Call to Unity 2:1–4

### Analysis

**2:1** Throughout chapter one, Paul has been hinting at the importance of unity among the believers—speaking of their participation with him in the ministry of the gospel, his own willingness to face those who preach the gospel out of “envy and strife” by celebrating the fact that the gospel was being preached, his willingness to delay being with Christ for the benefit of the people, and an exhortation that they stand firm in one spirit, “striving together for the faith of the gospel” (1:27, NASB). These obvious statements are reinforced by those more subtle moments in chapter 1 where Paul communicates the importance of humility and unity among church members.^[It is most likely that our previous presentations have covered these details. But if not, Hawthorne details many of these subtleties in his commentary.] As Paul opens chapter two, he has finally arrived at his most direct appeal to the church at Philippi. He clearly communicates his desire that they resolve their differences and choose to be unified into a cohesive community of believers.

Paul begins with a series of “if” statements (the protasis), the first three of which are structured as parallel objective genitives (or perhaps _source_—encouragement that comes _from_ Christ). Each of the protasis statements is assumed by both Paul and his audience to be true without dispute. The word for “encouragement” (παράκλησις) may also be understood to mean “exhortation” (used as a verb in Romans 12:1, παρακαλῶ). Those who adopt this meaning might read, as does Kent, the genitive construction as _grounds_ rather than _source_: “If there are any grounds for exhortation because you are in Christ, as indeed there are. . .”^[Homer A. Kent, Jr., _Philippians_, vol 11 of The Expositor’s Bible Commentary, ed. Frank E. Gaebelein, (Grand Rapids: Zondervan), 1984, 121.] My own preference is to read παράκλησις as encouragement—especially because it parallels so well with the two genitive phrases that follow it.

Paul follows these three strophes with two nouns (“affections and compassions”), neither of which has a related genitive. Understanding the God-centered nature of the previous genitive phrases (of Christ, of Love, of the Spirit), these two nouns could easily be understood to elliptically refer to that which comes from Christ. Others read the independent nominatives (σπλάγχνα καὶ οἰκτιρμοί,) with respect to Paul’s shift in focus toward the relationship of the Philippians to himself in the next verse, interpreting these “affections and compassions” to be from Paul, not from Christ.^[Gordon D. Fee, _Paul’s Letter to the Philippians_, _New International Commentary on the New Testament_, Accordance electronic ed. (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1995), 179.]

In any case, Paul opens chapter 2 with a series of rhetorical “if” statements (that may just as easily be translated as “since”) accepted by his audience to be undeniably true. These “if” statements provide the basis or his request: that the Philippians make his joy complete by humbly acting in ways that would foster unity in the church.

**2:2** Paul uses the next statement to indicate what it would mean for his joy to be made full, or complete.^[Note that the grammar at this point in the chapter is difficult enough that scholars disagree wildly on how Paul is using this ἵνα clause. See Hawthorne, p 85.] He then finishes out the verse by saying essentially the same thing several different ways: they were to have the same mindset, they were to have the same love, they were to be united, and they were to think the same things. It seems that Paul’s use of different words and phrases does little to shed additional light on the meaning of what he is saying; however, the compounding rhetorical effect of these phrases which all essentially mean the same thing communicate a sincere desire and passion from the author concerning this matter.

It seems clear from these opening verses that Paul believes pride is standing in the way of the church’s growth in unity.

**2:3** Paul fleshes out what unity in the church would look like (specifically dealing with those believers in Philippi, but ostensibly applying to any congregation of believers). He presents two parallel negatives: “nothing should be done according to strife” (μηδὲν κατ’ ἐριθείαν) and “nothing should be done according to empty selfishness” (μηδὲ κατὰ κενοδοξίαν). In both phrases, the κατὰ indicates a _mode_ or _manner_ of behavior, essentially describing a _way_ of behaving to be prohibited, rather than specific acts or behaviors. Paul contrasts these two parallel κατὰ phrases with a singular mindset, a singular focus for the people of Philippi: they were to act with humility (ταπεινοφροσύνῃ.^[BDAG defines this word as “humility, modesty.” ταπεινοφροσύνη is a compound word, combining the adjective ταπεινός (“lowly, subservient, humble”) and the noun φρόνημα (thinking, understanding).] Humility is the answer.

The phrase the follows (“regarding others as more important than yourselves”) should be understood as standing in apposition to humility—that is, describing how acting according to humility would differ from acting according to “strife” or “empty selfishness.” In a sense, Paul is explaining humility to mean regarding “others as more important than yourselves.”

**2:4** Continuing the others-focused nature of his exhortation, Paul commands the people not only to be looking out for their own things (doing that which is natural), but also to be looking out for the things of others (that which is supernatural). Paul uses the word σκοπέω to describe a looking out for, or a careful attention to a matter (see BDAG).

Through these verses, Paul indicates that “strife” because of “empty selfishness” that was plaguing the church could only be solved by the reverse attitude—selflessness humility that would bring about unity rather than strife.

### Structure

Although most look to 2:6–11 for the poetic portion of the book, chapter two seems to mark a slight shift in Paul’s rhetorical style towards being more elevated. The first two verses begin to sound poetic, falling into a perceptible poetic cadence.

“As Paul writes, his words have been seen to fall into three strophes . . . . The chiastic structure of 2:1–4, especially 2:2b–4, is dealt with in Peterlin, Paul’s Letter to the Philippians, 59–65.

(1) The first strophe is recognized by the fourfold εἴ τις /εἴ τι, “if in any way,” introducing four phrases, each of which is composed of two nouns and no verbs (v 1).

(2) The second strophe also has four parts. The first half is composed of two imperatives (ἵνα, “that,” with the subjunctive may be taken imperatively; cf. Moulton et al., Grammar, 3:94–95), and the second half is made up of two participles, with the verb φρονεῖν, “think, be of (one) mind,” marking the end of each half (v 2).

(3) The third strophe has six parts. The first half is discerned by three important nouns, and the last half by two participles and the twice-used ἕκαστος, “each” (vv 3–4; so Gnilka, who adapts Lohmeyer’s (72–73) strophic arrangement as in 1:27–30; he is followed by Black, JETS 28 (1985) 300; Silva; and O’Brien; yet Fee (1995), 177 n. 15, is critical).”^[Gerald F. Hawthorne and Ralph P. Martin, _Philippians_, vol. 43 of Word Biblical Commentary. Accordance/Thomas Nelson electronic ed. (Waco: Thomas Nelson, 2004), 81.]

Dr. Black, in his _JETS_ article from 1985 (referenced above by Hawthorne), outlines the three strophes in the following manner:

(1)   A    Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ,
        B    if there is any consolation of love,
        C    if there is any fellowship of the Spirit,
        D    if there is any affection and compassion,
(2)   A    fulfill my joy in being of the same mind,
              B    maintaining the same love,
              B    united in spirit
        A    intent on one purpose.
(3)   A    Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit,
              B    but with humility regard one another as more important than yourselves.
        A    Do not look out for your own interests
              B    but also for the interests of others.^[David Alan Black, “Paul and Christian Unity: A Formal Analysis of Philippians 2:1–4,” _JETS_ 28.3, September, 1985, 299–308, 301.]

The first four lines make up the first strophe, which designates the reason or basis for this appeal to be made. Paul makes the appeal that they “fulfill (his) joy” in the second strophe by acting as a unit, a cohesive whole, a unified congregation. The third strophe calls for the congregation to act out this humility by regarding others as more important than themselves.

## The Example of Christ 2:5–11

>**5**     Have this kind of thinking _be_ in you, which _was_ also in Christ Jesus.
6                       Who, being in the form of God
                           did not regard being equal with God
                           something to be grasped
7                       but rather he poured himself out^[“One need not imagine that the phrase means that Christ discarded divine substances or essences (Keck). Rather, it is a poetic, hymnlike way of saying that Christ poured out himself, putting himself totally at the disposal of people (cf. 1 John 3:16), that Christ became poor that he might make many rich (2 Cor 8:9; cf. also Eph 1:23; 4:10).” (Hawthorne, 117)]
                           taking the form of a servant
                           being born in the likeness of mankind
                           and being found in appearance as a man
8                       he humbled himself
                           by becoming obedient to the point of death—
                           even the death of a cross.
9                       Therefore even God has exalted him _to the highest_
                           and has graciously bestowed on him the name
                           which is above every name,
10                     so that to the name of Jesus
                           every knee will bow—
                           of beings in heaven and on earth and under the earth
11                     and every tongue will confess _out loud_
                           Jesus Christ is _the_ Lord
                           unto the glory of God the Father.

### Analysis

**2:5** Paul opens this second segment of chapter 2 with the present imperative, φρονεῖτε. The command to “have this mind” is at times translated passively, “let this mind be in you” (KJV), noting the logical difficulty of forcing a mindset upon oneself. However, I believe the more forceful, “Have this kind of thinking _be_ in you” communicates both the aspect of the present tense without being too cumbersome as well as the imperatival force of Paul’s command. Paul is not, as the KJV might suggest, simply suggesting that the Philippian people allow (“let”) the thinking of Christ to be in them, it is clearly a command that must be obeyed.

**2:6** Paul then marks the specifics of how Christ’s acts demonstrate his humility. The first detail provided by Paul is the fact that Jesus, who in eternity past existed in the “form of God” (that is, having all the properties of God, see the NIV “very nature of God”), but did not consider this position as something to be grasped.

The meaning of the word μορφῇ has been highly debated amongst scholars.^[Note that the author also uses this same construction later in the poem when it speaks of Jesus “taking the form of a servant” (μορφή dou/lou λαβών). Translators should try to highlight this apparent parallel construction by using the same (or similar root) English words.] Some, like Lightfoot, identified the term μορφῇ with Aristotle’s use, contrasting it with σχῆμα (2:7), “the latter referring to what is accidental and outward, the former to what is intrinsic and essential.”^[Donald MacLeod, _The Person of Christ_, Contours of Christian Theology, edited by Gerald Bray, (Downers Grove: Intervarsity), 1998, 212.] Lightfoot’s argument is that Jesus emptied himself of certain Godly abilities and attributes when he came as man, but retained all the essential qualities that made him God. An alternative to this approach, developed mostly by Kennedy and later by Martin, suggests that when determining the meaning of μορφῇ in this passage, one would do better to look at the Septuagint rather than the Greek Philosophers.

“Although the data are scarce they seem to warrant three conclusions: first, that in the few passages where _morph__ē_ is used it ‘denotes the form, appearance, look or likeness of some one, that by which those beholding him would judge him’; secondly, that _eikōn_ and _morphē_ are used as interchangeable terms in the Greek Bible; and, thirdly, that _eikōn_ and _doxa_ are also equivalent terms.

“Taking these facts together, it seems clear that _morphē_ belongs to a group of words which describe God not as he is in himself but as he is to an observer.”^[MacLeod, 213.]

Despite being in the “form of God,” Jesus did not “regard” equality with God something to be grasped. Some (Moule) have suggested a better interpretation would be that _precisely because_ Jesus was in the form of God, he did not regard equality with God something to be grasped.

The word translated “regard” (ἡγέομαι) is the same word Paul uses in 2:3 as part of a series of commands, including his desire for the people to be “regarding others _as_ more important than yourselves” (note parallels between 2:1–4 and 2:5–11, addressed later). This repetition of a slightly unusual word (only used 27 times in the New Testament) directly ties the behavior of Jesus Christ to the desired behavior from the people of Philippi.

When Paul says Jesus “did not regard being equal with God / something to be grasped, he is drawing a contrast between the humble Son of God and the prideful first man Adam’s desire to be “like God” when he grasped at the fruit of that forbidden tree (Genesis 3). Paul contrasts the damning acts of the first Adam with the saving “last Adam” in other passages^[See Romans 5:15 and 1 Corinthians 15:45.] so this comparison/contrast would not be out of character for Paul’s style.

| Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name, | Therefore God condemned him to suffering, and gave him the infamy of death (Gen 3:16–19),                                                                                      |

The comparisons between Adam and Jesus may put undue emphasis on the similarities between the two to the neglect of the message of the hymn (see p 112, Hawthorne).

**2:7** Rather than grasping, or holding on to something that was rightfully his, Jesus chose to “pour himself out.”^[For more information on ἐκένωσεν, see the Word Study: [[Philippians 2.1-18 Analysis#Word Study: (Phil 2:7, ἐκένωσεν, Aor/Act/Ind/3/S from κενόω, “poured himself out”)|Word Study]]] The next three lines all contain participles (λαβών, γενόμενος, εὑρεθεὶς) indicating the results of this selfless act: 1) he took the “form of a servant,” he was 2) “born in the likeness of mankind” and 3), was “found in appearance as a man.” Jesus’ pouring out meant that he “became flesh” so that he could “(dwell) among us” as one of us. (John 1:14).

Out of the thousands of selfless things Jesus did in his life, Paul points to the fact of the incarnation as proof of Jesus’ humility. It is the sheer scale and scope of this emptying (an infinite lowering) that would force the Philippian believers to recognize their obedience in this matter as something to be expected.

**2:8** Paul continues Jesus’ downward movement (see page 20) but couched in the context of his obedience to the Father. This obedience led Jesus to be obedient to the point of death. Paul uses the adjectival participle γενόμενος to communicate the extent or degree to which Jesus humbled himself.^[The participle could also be interpreted as result, meaning that Christ humbled himself with the result that he was obedient to the point of death.]

**2:9** Paul describes how Jesus, because of his obedience and humility, is suddenly exalted to the highest of all. Jesus did not seek to grasp a name, but rather he was given a name, or position, above all else. Jesus’ humiliation led to his exaltation. Note, however, that the actor in this verse is God the Father. Jesus does not exalt himself above all else; he is exalted by God (ὁ θεὸς αὐτὸν ὑπερύψωσεν). This emphasizes the point that Paul is making for the people of Philippi—that their selfish desires and promotional self-seeking would prohibit them from experiencing the benefits that Christ experienced. Of course, none of the Philippian Christians would ever be exalted to the same place as Christ, but they could still experience this same power of God when they submit and humble themselves.

**2:10–11** The result of Christ’s exaltation is that he is given the position only occupied by Jehovah God: every knee (of every being) will bow to him.^[Is. 45:23 (NASB) “I have sworn by Myself, The word has gone forth from My mouth in righteousness And will not turn back, That to Me every knee will bow, every tongue will swear allegiance.”] The break between 2:10 and 2:11 does not mean any break in Paul’s thought, for he continues with the other half of the worship of Jesus—that every tongue will confess that “Jesus Christ is _the_ Lord” (ἐξομολογήσηται ὅτι κύριος Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς). Although many translate this phrase to mean that all will confess Jesus is Lord (ruler, master), I believe Paul’s use here indicates that he is speaking of Jesus Christ being confessed to be _the_ Lord (Jehovah).

The LXX uses κύριος when interpreting the covenant name of the Lord (יהוה). Although the translation of “lord” or “master” may fit with the context of being worshipped, when taken with reference to other Old Testament passages in which Jehovah declares that he alone is worthy of any worship, it would seem more likely that this is a formal declaration of Jesus’ identification as Jehovah God.

Paul finishes the hymn with a doxology—”unto the Glory of God the Father.”

### Structure

Paul ends this first section of chapter two by explaining ways that the people of Philippi may act in a unified and humble manner towards each other. Then, as if struck in moment with the perfect example and motivation for his audience, Paul launches into his next segment focusing on the humiliation and exaltation of Jesus Christ.

But among the passages within Philippians, this may be the most difficult to interpret. As Hawthorne admits, “This is the most important section in the letter and surely the most difficult to interpret.”^[Hawthorne, 99.]

Why might Paul have chosen to speak of Christ’s incarnation in such poetic terms? Or, if one does not see Pauline authorship here, why might Paul have chosen to use an early Christian hymn and the example of Christ at this point in his letter? It is most likely that “Paul’s motive in using it here is not theological but ethical,” that is, that he chose to use Christ and His behavior as an example in order to motivate the same kind of behavior from the Philippians, not primarily to teach about the pre-existence of Christ or other related theological concerns.^[Gerald F. Hawthorne and Ralph P. Martin, Philippians, vol. 43 of Word Biblical Commentary. Accordance/Thomas Nelson electronic ed. (Waco: Thomas Nelson, 2004), 106.] This _ethical_ consideration seems to fits most logically into the broader context of Paul’s concerns for this church. It is highly doubtful, therefore, that Paul’s use of this hymn was to correct errant theology from the Philippians concerning their Christology. With this acknowledgement, the interpreter’s responsibility may reasonably become more focused on the issues of humiliation and exaltation of Jesus Christ and what it meant for Paul’s audience rather than, perhaps, the technical concerns of a systematic theologian parsing the finer nuances of what it meant for Jesus to be in the μορφῇ of God.^[Of course, these theological issues are important, but they should not occupy the center of this discussion to the neglect of the more important meanings of Paul’s words.] Paul further demonstrates this _ethical_ or _behavioral_ emphasis with an imperatival introduction to this poem in 2:5: “Let this mind (or kind of thinking) be in you.” Paul’s concern was that the thinking and behavior of the people of Philippi match that which Jesus would have done.

Note however, that Paul’s emphasis on the _ethical_ as the primary reason for the inclusion of the Christ Hymn into the text does not mean that theological implications of the poem should be avoided altogether.

The structure of the Christ Hymn (also referred to as the _Carmen Christi_) should be tied closely to the prior context, especially since the two sections seem to follow a parallel course and share many common key words.^[I would suggest that this parallelism between 2:1–4 and 2:5–11 might indicate Pauline authorship of the Christ Hymn—a hymn Paul may have written to flow naturally from his exhortation in the previous section. The other possible indication would be that Paul prepares 2:1–4 as a prologue to 2:5–11.] Dr. Black notes the parallels between 2:1–4 and 2:5–11:^[David Alan Black, “Paul and Christian Unity: A Formal Analysis of Philippians 2:1–4,” JETS (September 1985): 299–308, 304.]

Paul also closely connects 2:6–11 with the following context, using too many similar key words in 3:20–21 to be coincidence:^[David Alan Black, ““The authorship of Philippians 2:6–11: some literary-critical observations,” _Criswell Theological Review_ 2, (March 1, 1988): 269–289, 278.]

First, the poem proper must be divided into its component parts, consisting (broadly) of the humiliation of Christ (2:6–8) followed by the exaltation of Christ (2:9–11). These two elements stand in stark poetic contrast as the Son, the one who existed with God and in every way equal to God was humiliated to the point of a human death in perhaps the most humiliating death possible—Roman Crucifixion.

Second, Paul abruptly signals the exaltation of Jesus Christ by the Father that occurred after the death of Jesus. In doing so, Paul points not only to the historical event of the Resurrection, but also the eschatological reality of all creation bowing the knee and confessing him as God.

### The Humiliation (2:6–8)

The poem begins with the existence of the Son prior to his incarnation: the Son existed in the “μορφῇ θεοῦ” (_form of God_)_._ Paul establishes the clear teaching of the Son’s preexistence through opening, stating that Jesus existed as the Son of God before coming in the form of man.

This negative choice (“did not regard . . . grasped”) contrasts the Son who chose not to grasp at that which was already his—equality with God—with the first Adam who grasped at Godhood not his own. The poem delays the announcement of who this figure is by introducing him only by the relative pronoun, “who.” The author saves the name for a point of emphasis later in the poem.

Rather than grasping, this one “poured himself out” by taking (λαβών) the form (same word as used earlier, μορφή) of a servant. The object of this _pouring out_ is the person himself—not attributes or abilities.^[For the word study on ἐκένωσεν (κενόω), refer to page 13.] It does not seem to be Paul’s emphasis that Jesus became _less_ but rather that in taking on (λαβών) and becoming (γενόμενος), Jesus was _adding_ humanity. Because Paul combines the two ideas together—that Jesus took on the form of a servant and became a man—this has practical implications for the men and women of Philippi. As people, their place was to be a servant. The role of a servant is not one who could justify being proud; rather, his position is one of humility.

This humility resulted in Christ’s obedience to the ultimate point—the point of death.

### The Exaltation (2:9–11)

Beginning in 2:9, Paul contrasts his description of the systematic, step-by-step humbling of Christ with the sharp and sudden exaltation of Jesus. Notice the repetition of verb phrases to indicate Jesus’ obedience (_being, poured, taking, born, humbled, obedient_) forms a plodding cadence abruptly interrupted by the shocking reversal (“_exalted!_”). Paul seems to drive Jesus from the highest possible position to the lowest imaginable condition, only to reverse the entire process in one step.^[See the section on “Poetic Movement” for more analysis on this point. [[Philippians 2.1-18 Analysis#Poetic Movement]]]

Paul descries Jesus’ exaltation using the superlative ὑπερύψωσεν, indicating that he was exalted _above all else._ Although it is a _hapax legomenon_, occurring only this once in the New Testament, it is used several times in the LXX, including Psalm 97:9 (speaking of Yahweh), “For You are the Lord Most High over all the earth; You are **_exalted_** far above all gods.”

Especially significant to understanding the meaning of this larger text is the recognition that Christ humbles himself (actively) but is exalted by God (passively). The humiliation and exaltation stand in contrast to one another especially in their _actors_. Christ did not exalt himself, but because of his obedience _was exalted_.

### Word Study: (Phil 2:7, ἐκένωσεν, Aor/Act/Ind/3/S from κενόω, “poured himself out”)

The word κενόω appears four other times in four other verses of the New Testament—always in the writings of Paul.

- In Romans 4:14, Paul uses κενόω in the perfect middle (κεκένωται) to speak of faith being emptied of its power—essentially being “voided”—if the Law is able to make righteous.
- Paul uses κενόω with the same sense in 1 Corinthians 1:17, where he speaks of the cross of Christ being voided of its power if one were to speak with convincing words of clever speech rather than to preach the gospel with simplicity. In this case, Paul uses an aorist passive (κενωθῇ)—the cross of Christ is not _made void_.
- Again, in 1 Corinthians 9:15, Paul uses κενόω, but this time referring to the danger of his “boast” being voided or made empty by another person’s act.
- For the last occurrence of this word, in 2 Corinthians 9:3, Paul again speaks of his boasting being “voided;” however, this time he does so in the context of his boasting about the progress and growth of the Corinthian people being proven wrong by a personal visit from the “brothers.”

In none of the other contexts does κενόω ever refer to the act of a person as it does in Philippians 2:7, wherein Jesus is said to ἑαυτὸν ἐκένωσεν (κενόω himself). This makes its use in Philippians 2:7 especially difficult to the interpreter: did Jesus empty himself of certain attributes or prerogatives? Several scholars have wrestled with this question, arriving at a variety of answers (Hawthorne offers the following assorted views from a survey of the literature):

> “(1) of his glory (Plummer), (2) of his independent exercise of authority (Hendriksen), (3) of the prerogatives of deity (Lightfoot), (4) of the insignia of majesty (Calvin, Lightfoot), (5) of the “relative” attributes of deity—omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence (the kenoticists—e.g., C. Gore, P. T. Forsyth, H. R. Mackintosh), (6) of being equal with God (A. Oepke, TDNT 3:661)”^[Gerald F. Hawthorne and Ralph P. Martin, Philippians, vol. 43 of Word Biblical Commentary. Accordance/Thomas Nelson electronic ed. (Waco: Thomas Nelson, 2004), 117.]

But because the hymn itself remains silent concerning the object of Christ’s emptying (and laboring too much over this question may be missing the point), one may easily assert that this may, in fact, be the wrong question. The _kenosis_ of Christ may be a poetic way of picturing the emptying of Christ himself (ἑαυτὸν ἐκένωσεν) in the grand tradition of Old Testament sacrificial offerings that would include the pouring out of the drink offering. Paul uses this imagery of himself later in 2:17: “But if I am even being poured out as a drink offering upon your sacrifice and service of your faith, _then_ I am rejoicing, and I am rejoicing with all of you!” This seems not only to bring up the fewest broader theological difficulties, but also to fit the context of Paul’s letter.

Hawthorne notes:

> “One need not imagine that the phrase means that Christ discarded divine substances or essences (Keck). Rather, it is a poetic, hymnlike way of saying that Christ poured out himself, putting himself totally at the disposal of people (cf. 1 John 3:16), that Christ became poor that he might make many rich (2 Cor 8:9; cf. also Eph 1:23; 4:10).”^[Gerald F. Hawthorne and Ralph P. Martin, Philippians, vol. 43 of Word Biblical Commentary. Accordance/Thomas Nelson electronic ed. (Waco: Thomas Nelson, 2004), 117.]

A misunderstanding (and perhaps, overemphasis) of this verse had led to an incorrect belief called the _kenotic_ theory of the incarnation—the belief that Jesus emptied himself _of certain Godly attributes._ But, as Fee notes, this is a simple misunderstanding of both Pauline use of the word and the misassumption that Christ must empty himself _of something_: “(Christ) simply ‘emptied _himself_,’ poured himself out. This is metaphor, pure and simple.”^[MacLeod, 209.] Further, proponents of this theory are unable to convincingly answer the question of how the world was able to exist for 33 years while the One who held it together emptied himself of these abilities (Hebrews 1:3; Colossians 1:17).[[3

### Textual Issue: 2:11 ἐξομολογήσηται

Philippians 2:1–18 contains only one significant textual issue, and it offers little to no change in meaning for the text. Both the Nestle-Aland 27th edition and UBS 4th edition texts choose the aorist middle subjunctive third singular form ἐξομολογήσηται from ἐξομολογέω, “to confess,” for the textual variant reading in 2:11. Many early manuscripts support the subjunctive reading, including 𝔓46 (c. 200 ad, one of the earliest manuscripts available), Sinaiticus ℵ (4th century), Vaticanus B (4th century), and minuscules 256 (11th–12th century), 263 (13th century), 424 (11th century), and 1852 (13th century). The editors for the UBS 4th edition rate their choice of ἐξομολογήσηται as a {C}.

The alternate reading, ἐξομολογήσ**η**ται (future indicative) has similarly strong manuscript support, being found in A, C, D, F, G, and Ψ as well as several later uncials and minuscules.

## The Acts of Believers 2:12–18

> **12**  So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not just as when I am present only but now much more in my absence _from you_, be working out with fear and trembling the salvation which is your own;
> 13  For God is the one working in you even to desire and to do on behalf of his own good pleasure _toward you_.
> 14 Be doing everything without complaining or contradicting
> 15   in order that you may be blameless and flawless, the children of God in the middle of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the sky,
> 16   holding firm the word of life so that I may boast in the day of Christ that I have not run _this race_ in vain or toiled _over you_ in vain.
> 17   But if I am even being poured out as a drink offering upon your sacrifice and service of your faith, _then_ I am rejoicing, and I am rejoicing with all of you!
> 18   And you must rejoice and rejoice together with me.

### Analysis

**2:12** For the first time in the book, Paul calls the Philippian people his “beloved” to remind them of his standing and relationship with them as he gives them pointed commands.^[Gordon D. Fee, Paul’s Letter to the Philippians, New International Commentary on the New Testament. Accordance electronic ed. (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1995), 210.] His tone shifts from the theological to the intensely practical. However, it would be a mistake to think that Paul has abandoned the theological statements of 2:6–11 as he moves forward. No, like in many of his letters, it is the theology that propels Paul to make practical applications to the lives of his audience.

Although many English Bible versions introduce a hard break between 2:11 and 2:12, Paul does not. His transitional phrase, “so then” (Ὥστε) ties what he is saying to the previous paragraph, communicating _result._ Paul is saying that because of what he has just explained (2:6–11), their behavior should be different.

Paul then encourages the people to obey (ὑπακούω) just as Christ obeyed (ὑπήκοος), not only when he is present among them but also when he is absent.

Considering the previous context, it seems most consistent to interpret “working out (present tense) with fear and trembling the salvation which is your own” as a charge for the Philippians to be _acting out_ (humbling oneself for the purpose of church unity) what God has declared to be. The working out of this salvation should be done with fear and trembling before God—for God is witness (see 1:8).

**2:13** To answer the question posed earlier: “why would Paul have inserted this _Christ Hymn_ into the letter to the Philippians at this time,” I believe that a close examination of the immediately following context provides insight (albeit, not conclusive evidence) of what Paul’s was communicating.

This self-humiliation and God-exaltation sets the pattern Paul uses in this passage as encouragement for the people to be acting out his command for them to humbly live in unity. Just as Jesus was obedient to the point of death, the Philippians were to be obedient to Paul’s (and God’s) commands. Paul then uses a “for” statement, giving the reason that they were to be obedient, working out their salvation in this manner:

> 13   For God is the one working in you even to desire and to do on behalf of his own good pleasure _toward you_.

Just as Jesus humbled himself (active) and was exalted by God (passive), the people of Philippi were to humble themselves (active) and allow God to exalt them in due time (passive). It seems that Paul is making a persuasive argument from the greater (Christ’s obedience) to the lesser (their obedience).

Paul uses Jesus as an example of a humble, obedient, and submissive relationship to God the Father in the most basic and surface way. Naturally, no Philippian would ever be required to leave the status of being equal with God. However, they were required to humble themselves for the sake of the unity of the church. Being elevated to a position of importance, which seemed especially important even to Jesus’ disciples who wanted to sit next to him in his kingdom, was God’s business and not man’s.^[Note: Hawthorne’s understanding of 2:12 seems unconvincing. He also misses the vital parallelism between sections 2:5–11 and 2:12–18.]

That God is the one who is working—that God has both a plan and a process—would be an encouragement to a people being asked to do something as unnatural as to humble themselves.

**2:14** Paul continues this section on the acts of the believers by focusing on specific behavior problems from Philippi and how they might change under a new, humble congregation: they were to be doing everything (present tense linear action) without complaining or contradicting with one other. This disputing undoubtedly arose from the prideful hearts of the participants. Humility that would breed unity would have no room for these kinds of disputes.

**2:15** Paul then gives the reason that they are to act so differently in this world. They are to do things without complaining and contradicting because they would be shining “as lights in the sky” among a world that does not know the Lord Jesus. The church is to live out the humility of Christ.

**2:16** Paul connects emotionally with his audience as he exhorts them to hold on to the “word of life,” with the result that he may boast in the final day that his (Paul’s) work has not been without fruit. Paul opens himself up in a most personal way, expressing a doubt or concern that the people of Philippi might abandon the principles that he has set out for them to follow. Paul reveals that he has toiled hard over the people, that he considers his work with them (or perhaps his life) a long-distance race that has been full of pain and struggle. He recognizes that this pride, unchecked, will destroy their spiritual lives and his work over them would have been completely worthless.

The theme of “boasting” (καύχημα or καυχάομαι, Rom 2:17, 23; 4:2; 5:2–3, 11; 1 Cor 1:29, 31; 3:21; 4:7; 5:6; 9:15–16; 13:3; 2 Cor 1:14; 5:12; 7:14; 9:2–3; 10:8, 13, 15–17; 11:12, 16, 18, 30; 12:1, 5–6, 9; Gal 6:4, 13–14; Eph 2:9; Phil 1:26; 2:16; 3:3) is ubiquitous in Paul’s letters, and does not carry any of the negative connotations English speakers may import on it. Rather, it may be translated “to glory in something,” indicating that Paul finds great satisfaction in it and would have no problem bringing up their spiritual condition among his other Christian brothers and sisters.

**2:17** Paul echoes Christ’s pouring himself out and the Old Testament sacrificial offerings to describe how he feels in the work of the ministry. He echoes this same feeling of personal expense in other letters as well:

> 2 Corinthians 12:15 (NASB) “I will most gladly spend and be expended for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?”

**2:18** Finally, Paul uses the literary technique _inclusio_ (the repetition of key words) to indicate that this section has ended. He repeats the word for joy (χαρά, χαίρω), referencing the command in 2:2 “fulfill my joy.”

# Literary Features of The Carmen Christi (2:6–11)

The Christological hymn in Philippians 2:6–11 is one of the more aesthetically beautiful segments of Paul’s writing in the New Testament—rivaling only perhaps Paul’s description of Christian love in 1 Corinthians 13. Although most biblical scholars do not attribute this hymn to Paul but rather some unknown early Christian hymn writer, Dr. Black wrote an article in _Criswell Theological Review_ 2.2 in 1988 detailing his reasons for Pauline authorship.

When dealing with literary features of a text, it is important to take the poem in its entirety in order to understand what the author is seeking to communicate. Isolating certain phrases with disregard to the larger movement of the poem does great harm to the message of the work. Further, much of the communication of the poem is found in the form, structure, and other literary qualities of the piece. To divorce the words from the form is to do great disservice to the text, author, and reader. Only in the context of the whole may the meaning of the part be discerned.

Structure: Chiasm.

Although most English translations do not format 2:6–11 as a poem, the Nestle Aland 27th Edition of the Greek New Testament does.

## Poetic Lines

Taking Paul’s words as they stand, most scholars have a difficult time agreeing on exactly how the poetic form should be structured. Hawthorne discusses five different ways (he suggests there are many others), with pros and cons, the text has been poetically divided into _strophes_.^[Hawthorne, 100.] Fee disagrees entirely with labeling the hymn as a poem—rather he identifies it as exalted prose which tends to use when speaking of Christ.^[Gordon D. Fee, _Paul’s Letter to the Philippians_, New International Commentary on the New Testament. Accordance electronic ed. (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1995), 41.]

Many scholars’ attempts at finding the original form of the Christ Hymn Paul apparently uses as a source here rely upon the deletion of certain lines or phrases in order to create a symmetry or rhythm presupposed by the scholar’s hypothesis.

“The necessity of omitting words and phrases or altering expressions to make the strophes come out right, according to some preconceived notion of what they should be, used to make one suspicious of the whole procedure and caused one to ask whether this is not just some sort of game that scholars play.”^[Gerald F. Hawthorne and Ralph P. Martin, Philippians, vol. 43 of Word Biblical Commentary. Accordance/Thomas Nelson electronic ed. (Waco: Thomas Nelson, 2004), 102.]

Indeed, the responsibility of the scholar is not to reimagine the text into the form he might wish it existed, but rather to work the best he can with what has been provided. Interpreters must reject the temptation to omit lines simply because they do not fit with a certain poetic meter or pace.

(Note my translation for how I have chosen to read these poetic lines).

## Poetic Movement

The poem’s chiasm reflects the movement of Christ through the poem.

![](file:////Users/marshallfantiv/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image001.png)

It is the surprise exaltation of Christ that jolts our sensibilities and expectations—and herein Paul communicates his most important point: the actor of this exaltation is not Jesus Christ proper, but God the Father. From this lowest point of all, the Father vaults Jesus to the highest place of all, where he alone is worshipped by every being that has been created.

The “therefore” (διὸ καὶ) denotes a natural consequence of the previous acts.^[“This last half of 2:6–11 opens with a strong inferential conjunction (διὸ “therefore”) followed immediately by a second conjunction (καὶ, “also”), denoting that the inference is obvious. Together the words may be translated “as a consequence, therefore” (BDAG; BDF §442 [12]; 451 [5]).” (Hawthorne, 124).] By this, the author is communicating that although this may seem to be a unexpected consequence obedience leading to humiliation, it is in reality entirely consistent with God’s way of operating. It is, in a word, expected.

Further, Jesus’ name is not given _until the very end of the hymn_, creating a kind of climax of expectation.

## Triads

Paul uses triads in the victorious second section (2:9–11) of the Christological hymn to reinforce the completeness of Christ’s victory over death.

First, Paul repeats the word ὄνομα (name) until he has created a crescendo, a climax that results in the announcement of the identification of the one he has been speaking of (identified only as ὃς “who” in 2:6): Jesus!

> **9**       διὸ καὶ ὁ θεὸς αὐτὸν ὑπερύψωσεν  
         καὶ ἐχαρίσατο αὐτῷ τὸ ὄνομα  
                           τὸ ὑπὲρ πᾶν ὄνομα,  
**10**      ἵνα ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰησοῦ  
         πᾶν γόνυ κάμψῃ

Second, Paul gives three places, or sphere where Christ will be worshiped. This triad features the tri-level planetary system that would have generally been understood to mean all of the created world: “In heaven, on earth, under the earth” (ἐπουρανίων καὶ ἐπιγείων καὶ καταχθονίων).

Last, Paul uses the repetition of the word “every” (πᾶς: πᾶν {2:9}, πᾶν {2:10}, πᾶσα {2:11}) to build anticipation and reinforce this complete victory of Christ.

And to provide an extra visual impact to communicate the complete victory of Christ over all, Paul uses synecdoche^[Synecdoche is a literary device in which a part is made to represent the whole. Therefore, the “tongue confessing” would represent a person confessing and the “knee bowing” would represent a person bowing or worshipping.] of every tongue and knee.

# Conclusion

How it must have pained the Apostle Paul to hear news that pride stood in the way of unity in the Philippian church. This church, one of the few that had been a participant in the gospel ministry with him, was facing problems within their ranks. Paul’s solution was for the people to act out their salvation—to be obedient to God’s design and plan for their lives—by humbly submitting to God and each other. This humility would breed unity. Paul could think of no greater example for the Philippians to look to than Jesus Christ—who, being God was willing to be obedient to the point of a Roman Crucifixion. But just as Christ was not left alone but was exalted by God, these Philippians could be assured that their work to be humble and obedient would mean a unified church body, one that God would be sure to do. The same power that raised Jesus from the dead and exalted him to the highest of all places is working in the lives of believers to cause them to _desire_ and _do_ God’s good pleasure for their lives. This will only result in the outpouring of joy from everyone involved as they observe the supernatural work of God: bringing sinners together to live in unity with each other to the glory of God.
